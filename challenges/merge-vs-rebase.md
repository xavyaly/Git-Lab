# Merge Vs Rebase In Git



 Git Merge vs Git Rebase: Explanation with Practical Examples

Both `git merge` and `git rebase` are ways to integrate changes from one branch into another. While they achieve similar goals, they do so differently, impacting the Git history. Here's a detailed comparison with practical examples.

---

 1. Git Merge
- Definition: Combines two branches by creating a new merge commit. The history of both branches is preserved as-is.
- Use Case: Use when you want to keep the history of all branches visible.

# Practical Example of `git merge`
Scenario:
You have two branches:
- `feature` branch: Created to work on a new feature.
- `main` branch: The default branch.

Now you want to merge `feature` into `main`.

1. Check out the `main` branch:
   
   git checkout main
   

2. Merge the `feature` branch:
   
   git merge feature
   

Result:
- A new merge commit is created, combining the changes from both branches.
- The history looks like this:
  
  *   Merge branch 'feature' into main
  |\
  | * Commit 2 on feature
  | * Commit 1 on feature
  * Commit on main
  

This preserves the parallel histories of `main` and `feature`.

 2. Git Rebase
- Definition: Moves the commits of one branch to the tip of another branch, creating a linear history.
- Use Case: Use when you want a clean, linear history without merge commits.

# Practical Example of `git rebase`
Scenario:
Using the same setup (`main` and `feature` branches), you want to rebase the `feature` branch onto the `main` branch.

1. Check out the `feature` branch:
   
   git checkout feature
   

2. Rebase the `feature` branch onto `main`:
   
   git rebase main
   

Result:
- The commits in `feature` are replayed on top of the `main` branch.
- The history looks like this:
  
  * Commit 2 on feature
  * Commit 1 on feature
  * Commit on main
  

This creates a linear, cleaner history.

 Key Differences

| Aspect            | Merge                                                              | Rebase                                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| History            | Preserves the commit history of both branches (parallel history).     | Creates a linear history by "replaying" commits.                 |
| Commit             | Creates a new merge commit.                                           | Does not create a merge commit; re-applies commits on the base.  |
| Conflict Resolution| Conflicts are resolved during the merge process.                      | Conflicts are resolved for each commit being replayed.           |
| Use Case           | When you want to keep branch histories and commits intact.            | When you want a cleaner, linear commit history.                  |

 When to Use Merge vs Rebase

- Use `git merge`:
  - When working in a team environment, as it preserves branch histories and shows exactly how changes were integrated.
  - When the commit history is important for debugging or understanding the evolution of the code.

- Use `git rebase`:
  - For solo projects or small teams where you prefer a clean history.
  - Before merging a feature branch into `main`, you may rebase to squash and organize commits.

 Example with Conflict Resolution

# Merge Conflict Example
If there are conflicting changes in `main` and `feature`:

git merge feature

Git will stop and notify you about the conflict. You'll need to resolve the conflicts manually in the files, add the resolved files, and complete the merge:

git add conflicted_file
git commit


# Rebase Conflict Example
During a rebase, Git stops at the conflicting commit. You resolve the conflict, then continue the rebase:

git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts
git add conflicted_file
git rebase --continue


---

 Conclusion
- Use `git merge` when you value the branch history and need to track how changes came together.
- Use `git rebase` when you want a linear, cleaner history, especially for smaller or personal projects.

Both commands are essential tools, and understanding their differences helps you make the right choice for your workflow.
